# AWS Glue Script Testing

To make things work, I recommend using a virtual environment like a GitHub codespace or EC2 instance. Reason being to make this work, we need to install an older version of:

- Spark(3.3.0)
- Java(8)
- Python(3.10)

I'm following the [ aws-glue-libs ][ aws-glue-libs ] github repo to do this for Glue version 4.0. I recommend you do the same if you intend to run the script in this folder.
